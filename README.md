## About
In February of 2021, Texas experienced a series of extreme winter storms that exposed vulnerabilities in the power grid. The resulting power outages disproportionately affected different socioeconomic groups in Houston, Texas. Using..... this analysis investigates the impact of these power outages on census blocks by median household income. 

## Skills
This analysis harnesses a few valuable skills:
- Reclassify rasters
- Mask rasters
- Vectorize rasters
- Transform spatial data
- Buffering
- Mapping with tmap

I used the stars and terra packages for working with raster data and the sf package for working with vector data.
